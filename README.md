# NLP_EnrichNews_NER
I created this repo-sandbox for keeping scripts I played or experimented.</br>
Most of code are kept in ".ipynb" to show how each line of code works.</br>
</br>
There are many ways to improve this code such as clean, and concat tag I and B whcih have same tag behind - such as what I did (I-PERSON , B-PERSON)

### list of topics in this repo are list below</br>

<li>EnrichNews_NER.ipynb : to find " PERSON - VERB - NOUN " from longtext (News) </li>
